          "content": "Merge4Climate is a campaign organized by leaders in the emerging Regenerative Finance (ReFi) space to raise awareness among the wider Ethereum community about the importance of estimating and compensating for the historical emissions of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) era, as well as offsetting residual emissions associated with PoS and key off-chain infrastructure. . Beyond this initial campaign, there is a broader coalition forming, tentatively called ETH 4 Climate, which will carry on this work, spurring involvement and developing a robust system for tracking contributions under a “Big Tent” approach. Rather than insisting that every participant contribute according to a specific process, the aim is to bring together participants who want to help mitigate Ethereum’s environmental impact with builders who are bringing ecosystem service assets like carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates on-chain. . This website is powered by fastpages [^1], you can find the GitHub repository for this site to raise issues and propose changes here. .",

Join the ETH 4 Climate Discord to join the conversation and help develop Ethereum’s climate-positive strategy. . Spread the Word . Tweet about the importance of compensating for Ethereum’s historical Proof-of-Work emisisons and encourage organizations you are a part of and others in your work to sign the statement and commit to mitigating their historical emissions. . Retire Carbon . Given the large scale of all available emissions estimates (on the order of 10s of millions of tonnes) it seems safe to say this will be a years-long endeavor - but we don’t want to wait years to get the ball rolling and allow our community to demonstrate our commitment. . As a starting point for Ethereum L1 users to offset their emissions on an individual address basis, there are two calculators that allow you to easily go from inputting your address to calculated emissions to retiring carbon credits: . Offsetra’s carbon.fyi | EdenDAO’s footprint calculator | . For a full listing of available calculators, see this repository from BICOWG. . Using on-chain carbon credit retirement such as that linked to at the end of the carbon.fyi flow will result in an immutable, shareable retirement record on the Polygon blockchain and attribute the benefit of your retirement to this initiative to offset Ethereum’s historical PoW emissions. .",
